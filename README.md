# Lesson-3
I am Steven Cherry II. I am from Brooklyn, NY and recently I graduated from Univeristy at Albany with a Bachelors in Mathematics.
My career goals is to hopefully become an invesment banker or a data scientist.
I chose FinTech as a career path because these skills learned in the class are essential skills that are needed in this new world of technology.
